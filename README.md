## Description
Staying in a healthy romantic relationships requires consistent effort and dedication to our partners. As we often find - maintaining a strong relationship can be a challenge when life gets busy, and as we grow and change as individuals. We created Ignite to help couples connect, communicate, and find new ways to make one another feel loved. <br />
Our application allows the couple to have a shared account where they have access to a couple's dashboard with a few great features. Couples will have access to a 'Question of the Day' that will spark conversations and allow for a deeper understanding of one another. Each partner will also complete a questionnaire that will determine the primary way in which they feel loved. Additionally, each partner will have access to a list that will give them suggestions on how to make their partner feel most loved, based on the results of their questionnaire.
